# Introduction to HMI Smart Display Solutions
In recent years, we have witnessed a surge in the popularity of intelligent devices, making traditional buttons and switches obsolete. Instead, we now use touchscreens and voice commands to interact with machines and systems. This new way of human-machine interaction, or HMI, has revolutionized the way we control and monitor our devices. Espressif Systems, a leading provider of wireless communication solutions, has launched an HMI intelligent solution that takes advantage of the ESP32 series chips. With this solution, users can achieve device networking and diversified HMI functions with just one chip. The single-chip HMI solution is suitable for a range of vertical markets, including smart homes, home appliances, medical health, industrial control, and educational toys. Let's take a closer look at how this solution can transform the way we interact with our devices.
